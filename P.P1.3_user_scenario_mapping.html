<h3>Stella recently graduated from college and began working at her new part time job.
Now that she is making a better salary, she wants to begin investing in her hobbies more and start decorating
her room. She loves playing video games on her pc, but has trouble finding high quality tech that looks aethetically pleasing. She doesn't
 like any of the preset colors leading tech brands offer, and wants a very specific color theme in her room. Stella;s friend tells her about
CustomCtrl.com, and she is quick to customize her keyboard,headsets, mouse, and mousepad all in the color scheme she wants. Now, she is closer to
her dream gaming set up. She was even able to have her own name printed on some of the equipment.</h3>
