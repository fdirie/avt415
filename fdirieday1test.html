  <h4>Best Practices for The Mobile-First Approach</h4>
  <h2>Best Practices for The Mobile-First Approach</h2>
  <h2>1. Prioritize Page Content </h2>
  <h3>When it comes to mobile-first design, designers must bear in mind the fact that content is the key. As there are space restrictions on smaller screens, web designers must ensure that the most critical elements are prominently displayed since those are the ones users will actively look for.</h3>
  <h2>2. Deliver Intuitive Navigation</h2>
  <h3>Intuitive navigation is of utmost importance when it comes to delivering a neat and clean user experience on mobile devices. Web designers can leverage features like navigation drawers (using Hamburger menus) to display secondary elements of the website. This will help users to find the necessary information easily.</h3>
  <h3>Speed and intuitiveness go hand in hand. SpeedLab by BrowserStack instantly provides you Page Speed Score out of 100 for both Desktop and Mobile platforms. With these insights, your design team can optimize for a mobile-friendly interface across different mobile devices and browsers.</h3>
  <h2>3. Avoid Disruptive Pop-ups</h2>
  <h3>As mentioned frequently, mobile devices have space constraints and no user likes to be accosted with sudden pop-ups or advertisements taking over the screen. Website owners or designers must only focus on what’s important for users and provide them with the things they are looking for in the first place.</h3>
  <h2>4. Test on Real Devices Under Real Conditions</h2>
  <h3>The most effective way of ensuring that a website delivers optimal user experiences across devices is by testing them on real devices. This helps designers verify whether the website renders as expected across mobiles, tablets, and desktops. BrowserStack’s real device cloud provides teams and individual testers with 3000+ real devices and browsers for instant testing in real user conditions.</h3>
