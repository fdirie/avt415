<h1> International Skincare </h1>
<h2> My first idea that I want to work on is a site that sells international skincare. This website would be able to ship internationally
  with products from many different countries. I would have the main navigation to be separating the type of products (cleansers, toners, moisturizers, etc.)
  The user can also filter out products that are made for their skin type (dry, oily, combination, etc.) or for other skin concerns (eczema, dull skin, texture, etc.)
  My site would be special because it would sell products that are often harder to get or more expensive to buy outside of the country it was made in.

<h1> Aesthetic Gaming Gear </h1>
<h2> My second idea is to sell gaming equipment such as headsets, keyboards, mouse pads, mice, etc. The equipment would be
  themed different colors that the user can pick based on what theme they are into. Some items would have a customize option to
  allow the user to pick their own color themes or have their name printed on the item if it canbe done. </h2>

  <h1> Tea Subscription Service </h1>
  <h2> My third idea is to create a delivery subscription website that delivers samples of different blends of teas. The user
    can enter their taste preferences and allergies into their account, and they can control how often they recieve their Subscription
    of tea bags. The fequency of delivery would determine how big or small the package would be. If there is a flavor the user loves,
    and wants to purchase, they can purchase the full size of that tea through the website's store.</h2>
